Vacay For A Day (Project 3)

## Description
VFAD is Vacation For A Day. This web app's goal is to allow users (hosts) who want to put up their property up for rental for a day and for guest users to search for properties for a last minute rental or day rental booked in advance. The idea of this web app was to give users in search of property to, in a way, make last minute bookings of properties. Say for example, it's a hot summer's day and you want to host a pool or beach party, but you don't have a pool or access to your own beach, and you know all of the local beaches are going to be packed with people! So this gives guest users a opportunity to possibly book a renter's pool or private beach access through VFAD. 

Our stretch goal is to add the ability to place other items for rentals, such as boat, kitchen, and motorhome, etc. There will eventually be feature where hosts can upload their rental property and it will store it in a database.
